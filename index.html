                    Real talk, I was born in Africa; in a little town called Bamenda. I lived there for 20 years, and within those years I achieved some academic goals which are Ordinary level and Advance level certifications. I then moved to the U.S with my elder brother in 2014.

                Life have always been intersting, I love to travel(been in three continent), I also like to play soccer(The real football). Soccer is the only game we knew that pull a lot of of crowd, and brings out the excitment out of everyone. Never forget a game is always a game; everyone come ready to win, but it can go both ways for all we know.
